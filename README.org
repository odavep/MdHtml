* MdHtml
Markdown to HTML converter in Python and C.
* Why?
A fun task to try and grapple with, especially in C as a kind of pre-compiler
stage project (similar to precalc in Math classes).
I do actually require a markdown to HTML converter for my website, and instead
of loading and installing a very large and mostly obsolete package just for this
task I think I could try making my own.
* Structure
/converter.py/ is the file where I write templating code to think out what
features I want. It's good to use, not necessarily the fastest or cleanest but
it gets the job done. Most importantly, it's a minimum working product for use
straight away.

The /Converter/ cmake project is my C implementation of this transpiler system.
It uses a lot of techniques that I have learned from the dragon book, and I'm
kinda using it as an exercise in lexers and simple tokenizers, compiling content
from one format to another.
