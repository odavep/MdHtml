* MdHtml
Markdown to HTML converter in C.
* Why?
A fun task to try out, especially in C. I'm considering this project as a kind
of pre-compiler stage task. I do actually require a markdown to HTML converter
for my website, and instead of installing pandoc or something, I could try and
make my own.
* Structure
/converter.py/ is the file where I write templating code to think out what
features I want. It's good to use, not necessarily the fastest or cleanest but
it gets the job done. Most importantly, it's a minimum working product for use
straight away.


The /Converter/ project is the main source directory for my C implementation.
Currently, it's capable of converting simple markdown documents though it is not
capable of generating documents via templates. It's a bit of a mess, which I'll
start documenting over the next few days.
